The code for the ICPR 2020 [Text BLock Segmentation Competition](https://www.mathematik.uni-rostock.de/forschung/projekte/citlab/projects/text-block-segmentation-competition-icpr2020/competition-details/). 

[Results](https://www.mathematik.uni-rostock.de/forschung/projekte/citlab/projects/text-block-segmentation-competition-icpr2020/results/):

|             | F-Value Simple Track | F-Value Complex Track|
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| CITlab      | 0.934                | 	0.768               |
| Luan Pham [^1] and Tuan Anh Tran [^1] [^2]   | 0.999         | - |
| **Davood Wadi** [^3] | **0.995**                |  **0.887**               |
| Xinfeng Chang [^4], Luyan Wang [^4], Hui Li [^4], Adam Wu [^4] and Lianwen Jin [^5] | 0.997 | 0.954 |

The goal of participating in the competition is to show that simple DL architectures, such as MaskRCNN, coupled with mainstream image augmentations, can produce competitive results (even better results) than traditional computer vision techniques that require heavy feature engineering and extensive domain knowledge.
